what goes on in the background?
    Find the IP address of the domain we want to access
    given a URL a browser needs to determine what IP corresponds to that URL
        Name Resolution
            uses a DNS server
                checks an index of URLs and their corresponidng IP Addresses

For sites visited before the IP can be found in local caches
        browser
        OS
        Router
If a record is not found in these caches then the ISP needs to provide the IP address of the domain

Once the IP Address is collected then the browser will attempt to connect to the server

Once connected to the server the browser can send and HTTP Request 
    
browser generally creates get requests to get content from the server

Cookies are small peices of data stored by the browser and used to preserve information between page visits

we can also send POST requests

HTTP responses are what we get back from the server
    contain extra metadata

200 - request sucessful
404 - content not found

what is returned is an HTML document to describe the page's content and links to other resources to be fetched
    style sheets
    videos
    fonts
    JS
