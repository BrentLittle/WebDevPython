Mechanism used by browsers to determine whihc property declarations are applied
Selectors of a property determine the specificity weight
The property that has heightest weight gets applied
    
    div ul li {   
        this has a specificity weight of 3 as there are 3 type selectors
    }

    button[type = "submit]
    {
        This has higher weight as it has a classttribute selector and only one type selector
    }
    
    BUT

    [type = "submit]
    {
        This has higher lower weight than the last as it has no type selector
    }



    .list_item{
        This one wins over the one under as it has a higher weight
        due to having a class / attribute selector
    }

    VS 

    div ul li{

    }


    ID Selectors have a higher specificity

    Inline Styles have the highest specificity


    You can override specificity with !important
    div ul li{
        background-color: blue !important;
        This overwrites any higher specificity selectors that may overwrite 
        BUT if a higher specificity selector also using !important wins
    }
