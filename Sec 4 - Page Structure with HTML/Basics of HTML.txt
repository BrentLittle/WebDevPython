HTML documents are made up of units that describe the structure and meaning of a page's content
    Units are called HTML Elements

Write HTML Elements using Tags to determine where the elements start and end
content is inside the element if it is between the opening and closing tags.
Void elements cannot have content inside them only one singe tag rather than opening and closing
You can nest tags together
 
P ELEMENT
    paragraph element
    <p>Hello! I'm inside a paragraph</p>
    ^ Open                            ^Close

Can also add attributes in the HTML tags
    <input type="number" required />
                            ^ this value is required and form cannot be submitted until value is inputted by user
        attributes have three parts
            attribute name
            equals sign
            attribute value (between quotation marks)


Head Contains information about the webpage for the browser to use
the body contains the data that will be presented to the user



MOST COMMON HTML ELEMENTS:

span - 
    annotate small pieces of text
    add specific behaviour to this element
    very generic with no meaning
    treat as a last resort
    Example: highlighting words
        <p> Ticket availability is extremely limited! </p>
                                    ^^^  NOT GOOD <span> extremely </span>
        BETTER  <em>extremely</em>  ^^^

        If we want to change the colour of TIcket then span is a great choice

    used for links  <a href="google.com"> Go to Google </a>
    href stands for hypertext reference

Lists ol,ul,li - 
    Ordered (ol) and Unordered (ul) Lists
