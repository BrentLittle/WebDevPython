HTML documents are made up of units that describe the structure and meaning of a page's content
    Units are called HTML Elements

Write HTML Elements using Tags to determine where the elements start and end
content is inside the element if it is between the opening and closing tags.
Void elements cannot have content inside them only one singe tag rather than opening and closing
You can nest tags together
 
P ELEMENT
    paragraph element
    <p>Hello! I'm inside a paragraph</p>
    ^ Open                            ^Close

Can also add attributes in the HTML tags
    <input type="number" required />
                            ^ this value is required and form cannot be submitted until value is inputted by user
        attributes have three parts
            attribute name
            equals sign
            attribute value (between quotation marks)
