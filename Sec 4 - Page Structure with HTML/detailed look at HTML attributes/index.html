        <p class="text">This is class text. The class attribute can be applied to ANY element</p>
        <p class="text">By using class text, I can also manipulate this text as well as it is also class text</p>
        <p class="text text1 text2">This text is apart of multiple classes</p>

        <h1 class="title awesome" id="pageTitle">This is apart of 2 classes and has id=PageTitle</h1>
        <p class="text">Classes are used for styling rather than IDs due to the ID (if unique)
            prevents the ability for code reuse in our CSS file as we will need different code for each ID
        </p>
        <p class="text">re-using code allows for codebase to be smaller and pages load faster as well as 
            only typing out code once and if there needs to be a change applied we only <br>need to go to one place to change and causes less chances for mistakes
