Users are apart of the team
    one person of the team is responsible for representing the users

In a solo project you should sit down think about hwat you have accomplished and 
plan next steps

Users wont create their own app if something already exists
    research competitors
        view what they do well and what they can improve on to see if it is worth your time to 
        invest developing a product

What users want with user stories

1.  As a user i would like to be abel to add a new journal entry so that i can keep track
    of my programming over time.

2.  As a user i would like to be able to easily see past journal entries in a simple way so 
    i can remember what i have learnt.

3.  I would like to be able to access my journal from any device throuhg a website


User stories contain what and why but NEVER How
